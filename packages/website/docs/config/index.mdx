# Configuration Reference

Scaffoldly's configuration is designed to be in-line with your project setup, allowing you to easily manage your deployment settings.

The configuration is stored in the `package.json` file of your project, making it easy to version control and share with your team.

## Using `package.json`

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  // other package.json configuration....
  "scaffoldly": {
    "runtime": "node:22-alpine",
    "handler": "localhost:3000",
    "services": [
      {
        "name": "next",
        "files": ["package.json", "build", "node_modules", "package-lock.json"],
        "scripts": {
          "install": "npm install",
          "dev": "npm run dev",
          "build": "npm run build",
          "start": "npm run start"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## `runtime`

This is the base image used for your application. You can specify any valid Docker image. In the example above, we are using `node:22-alpine`, which is a lightweight Node.js image.

## `handler`

The handler specifies the entry point for your application. This is typically the URL or path where your application is served. In the example, it is set to `localhost:3000`, which is where a NodeJS application runs during development.

## `services`

The services array allows you to define multiple services that your application may consist of. Each service can have its own configuration, including:

- `name`: The name of the service.
- `files`: An array of files or directories to include in the deployment package.
- `scripts`: Scripts to run for the service, such as installation, development, build, and start commands.

### `name`

The name of the service. This is used to identify the service during deployment.

### `files`

An array of files or directories to include in the deployment package. This allows you to specify exactly what should be packaged and deployed.

### `scripts`

Scripts that are executed during different stages of the application lifecycle. Common scripts include:

- `install`: Command to install dependencies.
- `dev`: Command to start the application in development mode.
- `build`: Command to build the application for production.
- `start`: Command to start the application in production mode.
