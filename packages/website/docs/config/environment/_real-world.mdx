## A Real-World Example

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

Let's build out secrets and environment variables for a real-world application that connects to a PostgreSQL database and uses SendGrid for sending emails.

Your application needs:

- A database URL
  - Developers use `postgresql://root:testing@localhost:5432/mydb` locally
  - A different Database URL for use in production
- An API key for SendGrid
  - Developers get this value from 1Password for their local environment
  - A different API key for use in production

Set up your project, and GitHub Actions in the following way:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="profile" label="Local Environment">

```bash title=".profile"
export SENDGRID_API_KEY="some_shared_sendgrid_api_key" # copied from 1Password
```

    Explanation:
     - Since `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is sensitive, it should not be stored in your codebase.
     - `dotenv` will pull it into `.env` at runtime.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="dotenv" label=".env File">

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://root:testing@$localhost:5432/mydb"
SENDGRID_API_KEY="${SENDGRID_API_KEY}" # injected using dotenv-expand
```

    Explanation:
     - The `.env` file contains the "default" local environment variables for local development.
     - `dotenv` will pull in the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` from your profile.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="github-secrets" label="Repository Secrets">

    - `DATABASE_URL`

        ```
        postgres://some-username:some-password@mydbinstance.abcdefghij.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/some-database
        ```

    - `SENDGRID_API_KEY`:

        ```
        a_different_sendgrid_api_key`
        ```

    Explanation:
     - We're using GitHub as a secret store for sensitive information.
     - Scaffoldly will automatically upload these secrets into the Secret Store during deployment.
     - Scaffoldly will inject these secrets as environment variables at runtime.

    See: [GitHub Repository Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="scaffoldly-config" label="Scaffoldly Config">

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-app",
  // other package.json configuration....
  "scaffoldly": {
    "secrets": ["SENDGRID_API_KEY", "DATABASE_URL"]
    // other scaffoldly configuration...
  }
}
```

    Explanation:
     - The `secrets` array specifies which match with secrets in GitHub Repository secrets.
     - Scaffoldly will automatically upload these secrets into the Secret Store during deployment.
     - Scaffoldly will inject these secrets as environment variables at runtime.

    See: [Secrets](/docs/config/#secrets)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="github-action" label="GitHub Action">

```yaml title=".github/workflows/scaffoldly.yml"
name: Scaffoldly
# other workflow configuration...
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy
        uses: scaffoldly/scaffoldly@v1
        with:
          secrets: ${{ toJSON(secrets) }} # inject repository secrets
```

    Explanation:
     - The `secrets` input passes the GitHub repository secrets to the Scaffoldly action.
     - Scaffoldly will automatically upload these secrets into the Secret Store during deployment.
     - Scaffoldly will inject these secrets as environment variables at runtime.

    See: [GitHub Action Reference](/docs/gha)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="app" label="Your Application">

    Your application _might_ need to add `dotenv` and `dotenv-expand`:

```javascript
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
const dotenvExpand = require('dotenv-expand');

dotenvExpand(dotenv.config());
```

```javascript
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
const sendgridApiKey = process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY;
```

    Explanation:
     - Using `dotenv` and `dotenv-expand`, environment variables and secrets can be accessed in your application code.
     - Secrets are copied from GitHub Actions and re-injected as environment variables during runtime.
