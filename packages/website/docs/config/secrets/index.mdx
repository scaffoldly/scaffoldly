# Secrets

Scaffoldly provides a way to manage sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, without exposing them in your codebase. Instead of hardcoding secrets in your application, you can use the Secrets feature to securely store and access them.

Since Scaffoldly integrates with GitHub Actions, you can use GitHub Secrets to store your sensitive data, and transparently inject them into your application at runtime.

## Setting Up Secrets

:::note

Secrets are only synchronized to the runtime environment during the deployment process. If a secret is updated in GitHub, you must re-deploy your application to synchronize the changes.

You may trigger a deployment by pushing changes to your repository, or by manually triggering the GitHub Actions workflow.

⚠️ Running `npx scaffoldly deploy` locally **will not** synchronize secrets from GitHub

:::

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
1. Navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
1. Click on `New repository secret` to add a new secret.
1. Enter the name of your secret (e.g., `MY_SECRET`) and its value.
1. Click `Add secret` to save it.

### Pushing and Accessing Secrets

You can access the secrets in your GitHub Actions workflow using the `secrets` context. Here’s an example of how to use it in your `.github/workflows/scaffoldly.yml` file:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="github-action" label="GitHub Action">

```yaml title=".github/workflows/scaffoldly.yml"
name: Scaffoldly Deploy

jobs:
  deploy:
    # ... snip ...
    - name: Deploy
      uses: scaffoldly/scaffoldly@v1
      with:
        secrets: ${{ toJSON(secrets) }} # inject repository secrets
```

    Explanation:

    - The `secrets` context allows you to access all the secrets you have defined in your GitHub repository.
    - The `toJSON(secrets)` function converts the secrets into a JSON format that can be used by the Scaffoldly action.
    - The `Deploy` step uses the `scaffoldly` copies the secrets into the deployment environment.

    See: [GitHub Action Reference](/docs/gha) for more information.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="scaffoldly-configuration" label="Scaffoldly Configuration">

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-app",
  // other package.json configuration....
  "scaffoldly": {
    "secrets": ["MY_SECRET"]
    // other scaffoldly configuration...
  }
}
```

    Explanation:

    - The `secrets` array specifies which secrets from your GitHub repository should be uploaded to the Secret Store during deployment.
    - The names must match the names of the secrets defined in GitHub.

    See: [Configuration Reference](/docs/config) for more information.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="your-app" label="Your Application">

```javascript
const mySecret = process.env.MY_SECRET;
```

    Explanation:

    - The `secrets` array specifies which secrets from your GitHub repository should be uploaded to the Secret Store during deployment.
    - The secrets will be injected as environment variables at runtime, allowing you to access them in your application code.

    See: [Environment Variables](/docs/config/environment) for more information.
