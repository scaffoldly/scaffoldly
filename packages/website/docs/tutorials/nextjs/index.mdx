# NextJS Tutorial

# Deploying a New NextJS Application to AWS Lambda Using Scaffoldly

In this guide, we'll go through the steps to deploy a new NextJS application to AWS Lambda using the `scaffoldly` CLI tool. You'll have a fully functional, serverless NextJS app running on AWS in no time!

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with administrative privileges.
- Node.js and `npx` installed.
- Docker installed (for building images).
- Scaffoldly CLI, which can be run with `npx scaffoldly`.

## Step 1: Setting Up AWS Permissions

Before deploying your application, you need to grant Scaffoldly the necessary AWS permissions to manage services like Lambda, ECR, and IAM. To generate the required permissions, run the following command:

```bash
npx scaffoldly show permissions --preset nextjs
```

This will output the necessary IAM policy that you need to attach to your AWS user or role. Follow these steps to configure AWS:

1. Open the **AWS IAM Console**.
2. Create or select an IAM User.
3. Copy the permissions output from the Scaffoldly command and paste it into a new policy attached to your user.
4. Run `aws configure` to set up your AWS credentials.

Once you've set up the permissions, you're ready to deploy your NextJS app.

:::tip

Scaffoldly supports methods other than IAM Users, such as IAM Roles and Profiles. See [AWS](/docs/cloud/aws#authentication-methods) for more information.

## Step 2: Deploying Your NextJS Application

With permissions set up, it's time to deploy your NextJS application using Scaffoldly. If you don't already have a NextJS app, you can create one by running:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
cd my-next-app
```

To deploy your app to AWS Lambda using Scaffoldly, run the following command:

```bash
npx scaffoldly deploy --preset nextjs
```

This command will automatically package and deploy your NextJS app, taking care of all AWS configurations such as Lambda functions, IAM roles, and a publicly accessible Function URL. The `--preset nextjs` option configures the deployment specifically for a NextJS application.

Here's an example output of the deployment process:

```bash
âœ… Updated Identity: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/scaffoldly
âœ… Updated ECR Repository: my-next-app
âœ… Updated Local Image Digest: sha256:8cd79bd887e8fe17dc80717ef560504bc7f83b01569bdfe1bc17f7eb0ae73b98
âœ… Updated Secret: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:my-next-app@main-I0l2Eb
âœ… Updated IAM Role: my-next-app-b7547354
âœ… Updated IAM Role Policy: my-next-app
âœ… Updated Lambda Function: my-next-app
âœ… Updated Function URL: https://2dapk4ireswcwkyxcas6uvbk2a0zgphr.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
âœ… Updated Function Policies: InvokeFunctionUrl
âœ… Updated Schedule Group: my-next-app-b7547354
âœ… Updated Local Image: 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-next-app:0.1.0-b7547354

âœ… Updated Function Alias: main (version: 1)
âœ… Updated Function URL: https://2dapk4ireswcwkyxcas6uvbk2a0zgphr.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws

ðŸš€ Deployment Complete!
   ðŸ“„ Env Files: .env.main, .env
   ðŸ“¦ Image Size: 641.55 MB
   ðŸŒŽ Function URL: https://2dapk4ireswcwkyxcas6uvbk2a0zgphr.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
```

</details>

## Step 3: Verifying the Deployment

Once the deployment is complete, Scaffoldly will provide a **Function URL** where your NextJS app is hosted. To verify that your application is live, simply open the provided URL in your browser:

```bash
ðŸŒŽ Function URL: https://2dapk4ireswcwkyxcas6uvbk2a0zgphr.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
```

This URL will take you to your newly deployed NextJS application running on AWS Lambda.

### Additional Information

- **Environment Files:** Scaffoldly generates `.env.main` and `.env` files containing environment variables for your deployment.
- **Image Size:** Scaffoldly provides the size of the Docker image used for your deployment.

## (Optional) Step 4: Save Configuration

Now that the deployment is complete, you may want to save your Scaffoldly configuration for future deployments. You can do this by running:

```bash
npx scaffoldly show config --preset nextjs --save
```

This command will save the `--preset nextjs` configuration to `package.json`, eliminating the need to include the `--preset` flag on `scaffoldly` commands in the future.

:::tip

See the [Configuration Reference](/docs/config) for more details on the `scaffoldly` configuration options in `package.json`.
