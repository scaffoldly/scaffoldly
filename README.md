Scaffoldly is a **new framework** for **packaging and deploying** applications to AWS.

It is a **open-source**, **no-code**, **developer-focused** solution that simplifies the packaging and deployment process for modern web applications.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Docker Image Generation**: No need to write Dockerfiles manually.
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Automatically create and manage AWS resources.
- **Built-in CI/CD Support**: Integrate with GitHub Actions for seamless deployments.
- **Environment Variables and Secrets**: Dotenv and GitHub Secrets are built-in.
- **Minimal configuration required**: Get started quickly with sensible defaults.
- **Built for the Public Cloud**: Deploy applications to AWS Lambda effortlessly. Don't get locked into using Vercel or Netlify.
- **Cost Effective**: Only pay for what you use with AWS Lambda.

âœ¨ Our **[documentation site](https://scaffoldly.dev)** is built and deployed **using Scaffoldly**, which uses the **Docusaurus Framework**, and is hosted on **AWS Lambda**! [_Learn More_](/about).

## Usage

Using a minimal configuration, the `scaffoldly` toolchain can package and deploy an application:

```jsonc title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  // other package.json
  "scaffoldly": {
    "runtime": "node:22-alpine",
    "handler": "localhost:3000",
    "files": [".next", "node_modules", "package.json", "package-lock.json"],
    "scripts": {
      "install": "npm install",
      "dev": "npm run dev",
      "build": "npm run build",
      "start": "npm run start"
    }
  }
}
```

Running [`scaffoldly deploy`](#command-line-interface) or the [GitHub Action](#github-action) will automatically create and push a multi-stage Docker build to ECR and deploy it to AWS Lambda.
